## Overview
CheatLogs is a cheatsheet management application that revolutionizes the world of programming.
CheatLogs uses a hybrid of Command Line (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) to interact with the user. 
We believe that the command line interface provides a fast user interaction.
While the graphical user interface, provides extra convenience to type long contents with a simple and a familiar interface for the user.
